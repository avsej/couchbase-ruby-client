# Release Notes

This document is a list of user visible feature changes and important
bugfixes. Do not forget to update this doc in every important patch.

## 1.2.1 (UNRELEASED)

* [major] RCBC-101 Persistence constraints wasn't passed to mutation
  methods, so they haven't been applied properly.

* [major] RCBC-102 Inconsistent return values in case of storage
  functions with persistence constraints. It always return a Hash like
  in case of multi-set, even if there is only one document is being
  set.

* [minor] Bucket#design_docs will return a Hash with DesignDoc
  instances as a values.

* [critical] RCBC-104 Data corruption on intensive store operations.
  The issue could also lead to segfaults.

* [major] Allow to use Bucket instance in completely asynchronous
  environment like this, without blocking on connect:

         conn = Couchbase.new(:async => true)
         conn.run do
           conn.on_connect do |res|
             if res.success?
               #
               # schedule async requests
               #
             end
           end
         end

* Specialized io plugin for releasing Ruby GVL (thanks to
  Sokolov Yura aka funny_falcon).

  * Ruby 1.9.x uses global lock for ensuring integrity, and blocking

## 1.2.0.z.beta3 (2012-10-16)

 18 files changed, 241 insertions(+), 57 deletions(-)

* RCBC-52 Implement bucket create/delete operations. Examples:

         conn = Couchbase::Cluster.new(:hostname => "localhost",
                  :username => "Administrator", :password => "secret")
         conn.create_bucket("my_protected_bucket",
                  :ram_quota => 500, # megabytes

## 1.2.0.z.beta  (2012-09-18)

 2 files changed, 5 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

* Fix version ordering by using ".z" prefix before .beta. The problem
  is that DP (Developer Preview) should have lower precedence than
  Beta, but alphabetially ".beta" orders before ".dp". This is why
  further Beta versions have ".z".

## 1.2.0.beta (2012-09-18)

 51 files changed, 9301 insertions(+), 3364 deletions(-)

* CCBC-98 Expose client temporary failure error

* RCBC-28 Implement Bucket#unlock

         # Unlock the single key
         val, _, cas = c.get("foo", :lock => true, :extended => true)
         c.unlock("foo", :cas => cas)

         # Unlock several keys
         c.unlock("foo" => cas1, :bar => cas2)
         #=> {"foo" => true, "bar" => true}

* Fix CAS conversion for Bucket#delete method for 32-bit systems

## 1.1.5 (2012-09-17)

 3 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)

* RCBC-81 Fixed installing issue on Mac OS X.

## 1.1.4 (2012-08-30)

 5 files changed, 64 insertions(+), 30 deletions(-)

* RCBC-37 Allow to pass intial list of nodes which will allow to
  iterate addresses until alive node will be found.

         Couchbase.connect(:node_list => ['example.com:8091', 'example.org:8091', 'example.net'])

* RCBC-70 Fixed UTF-8 in the keys. Original discussion
  https://groups.google.com/d/topic/couchbase/bya0lSf9uGE/discussion

## 1.2.0.dp6 (2012-06-28)

 21 files changed, 1520 insertions(+), 428 deletions(-)

* RCBC-47 Allow to skip username for protected buckets. The will use
  bucket name for credentials.

* Expose number of replicas to the user

* RCBC-6 Implement Bucket#observe command to query durable state.
  Examples:

         # Query state of single key
         c.observe("foo")
         #=> [#<Couchbase::Result:0x00000001650df0 ...>, ...]

         # Query state of multiple keys
         keys = ["foo", "bar"]
         stats = c.observe(keys)
         stats.size   #=> 2
         stats["foo"] #=> [#<Couchbase::Result:0x00000001650df0 ...>, ...]

* RCBC-49 Storage functions with durability requirements

        # Ensure that the key will be persisted at least on the one node
        c.set("foo", "bar", :observe => {:persisted => 1})

* RCBC-50 Allow to read keys from replica

* RCBC-57 Expose timers API from libcouchbase

* RCBC-59 Replicate flags in Bucket#cas operation

* Apply timeout value before connection. Currently libcouchbase shares
  timeouts for connection and IO operations. This patch allows to
  setup timeout on the instantiating the connection.

* RCBC-39 Allow to specify delta for incr/decr in options

* RCBC-40 Fix Bucket#cas operation behaviour in async mode. The
  callback of the Bucket#cas method is triggered only once, when it
  fetches old value, and it isn't possible to receive notification if
  the next store operation was successful. Example, append JSON
  encoded value asynchronously:

        c.default_format = :document
        c.set("foo", {"bar" => 1})
        c.run do
          c.cas("foo") do |val|
            case val.operation
            when :get
              val["baz"] = 2
              val
            when :set
              # verify all is ok
              puts "error: #{ret.error.inspect}" unless ret.success?
            end
          end
        end
        c.get("foo")      #=> {"bar" => 1, "baz" => 2}

* RCBC-43 More docs and examples on views

* RCBC-37 Bootstrapping using multiple nodes

        Couchbase.connect(:node_list => ['example.com:8091', 'example.org:8091', 'example.net'])

* Inherit StandardError instead RuntimeError for errors

## 1.2.0.dp5 (2012-06-15)

 12 files changed, 939 insertions(+), 20 deletions(-)

* Integrate with Rack and Rails session store

        # rack
        require 'rack/session/couchbase'
        use Rack::Session::Couchbase

        # rails
        require 'action_dispatch/middleware/session/couchbase_store'
        AppName::Application.config.session_store :couchbase_store

* Implement cache store adapter for Rails

        cache_options = {
          :bucket => 'protected',
          :username => 'protected',
          :password => 'secret',
          :expires_in => 30.seconds
        }
        config.cache_store = :couchbase_store, cache_options

* Implement key prefix (simple namespacing)

        Couchbase.connect(:key_prefix => "prefix:")

* Allow to force assembling result Hash for multi-get

        connection.get("foo", "bar")
        #=> [1, 2]
        connection.get("foo", "bar", :assemble_hash => true)
        #=> {"foo" => 1, "bar" => 2}

## 1.2.0.dp4 (2012-06-07)

 4 files changed, 34 insertions(+), 19 deletions(-)

* Update Bucket#replace documentation: it accepts :cas option

* RCBC-36 Fix segfault. Occasional segfault when accessing the
  results of a View. https://gist.github.com/2883925

## 1.2.0.dp3 (2012-06-06)

 4 files changed, 22 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)

* Fix for multi_json < 1.3.3

* Break out from event loop for non-chunked responses. View results
  are chunked by default, so there no problems, but other requests
  like Bucket#save_design_doc() were "locking" awaiting forever.

## 1.2.0.dp2 (2012-06-06)

 22 files changed, 859 insertions(+), 253 deletions(-)

* RCBC-31 Make Bucket#get more consistent. The pattern of using more
  than one argument to determine if an array should be returned is not
  idiomatic. Consider the case of a multi-get in an application where
  I have n items to return. If there happens to be only one item it
  will be treated differently than if there happens to be 2 items.

        get(["foo"])  #=> ["bar"]
        get("foo")    #=> "bar"
        get(["x"], :extended => true) #=> {"x"=>["xval", 0, 18336939621176836096]}

* Use monotonic high resolution clock

* Implement threshold for outgoing commands

* Allow to stop event loop from ruby

* RCBC-35 Fix the View parameters escaping. More info at
  https://gist.github.com/2775050

* RCBC-34 Use multi_json gem. json_gem compatibility (require
  'yajl/json_gem') is notorious for causing all kinds of issues with
  various gems. The most compatible way to use yajl is to call
  Yajl::Parser and Yajl::Encoder directly.

* Allow to block and wait for part of the requests

* Fixed view iterator. It doesn't lock event loop anymore This used to
  cause "locks", memory leaks or even segmentation fault.

* Define views only if "views" key presented

* Require yajl as development dependency

* RCBC-76 Implement get with lock operation. Examples:

        # Get and lock key using default timeout
        c.get("foo", :lock => true)

        # Determine lock timeout parameters
        c.stats.values_at("ep_getl_default_timeout", "ep_getl_max_timeout")
        #=> [{"127.0.0.2:11210"=>"15"}, {"127.0.0.1:11210"=>"30"}]

        # Get and lock key using custom timeout
        c.get("foo", :lock => 3)

* Update documentation

## 1.1.3 (2012-07-27)

 5 files changed, 192 insertions(+), 101 deletions(-)

* RCBC-64 The Couchbase::Bucket class hasn't implemented the #dup
  method. So it caused SEGFAULT. The patch is implementing correct
  function, which copy the internals and initializes new connection.

* RCBC-59 The flags might be reset if caller will use
  Couchbase::Bucket#cas operation. Here is IRB session demonstrating
  the issue:

        irb> Couchbase.bucket.set("foo", "bar", :flags => 0x100)
        17982951084586893312
        irb> Couchbase.bucket.cas("foo") { "baz" }
        1712422461213442048
        irb> Couchbase.bucket.get("foo", :extended => true)
        ["baz", 0, 1712422461213442048]


* RCBC-60 Make object_space GC protector per-bucket object. Previous
  version provided not completely thread-safe bucket instance, because
  it was sharing global hash for protecting objects, created in
  extension, from garbage collecting.

## 1.1.2 (2012-06-05)

 5 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)

* Upgrade libcouchbase dependency to 1.0.4. Version 1.0.4 includes
  important stability fixes.

* Backport debugger patch. The gem used to require debugger as
  development dependency. Unfortunately ruby-debug19 isn't supported
  anymore for ruby 1.9.x. But there is new gem 'debugger'. This patch
  replaces this dependency.

## 1.2.0.dp (2012-04-10)

 19 files changed, 1606 insertions(+), 93 deletions(-)

* Properly handle hashes as Couchbase.connection_options. Fixed a bug
  when 'Couchbase.connection_options' for "default" connection, when
  there are several arguments to pass to the connect() function when
  establishing thread local connection as below:

        Couchbase.connection_options = {:port => 9000, :bucket => 'myapp'}

* Implement views. Couchbase Server Views are accessible using the
  view APIs. Please refer to
  http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-views.html
  for getting started with views.

* Use verbose mode by default throwing exceptions on NOT_FOUND errors.
  This means that quiet attribute is false now on new connections.

* Documentation fixes

## 1.1.1 (2012-03-19)

 5 files changed, 83 insertions(+), 23 deletions(-)

* Flags are used differently in different clients for example between
  Python and Ruby. This fix will force the format to a known value
  irrespective of the flags.

* Calls between Ruby and C libraries for Couchbase which involved
  default arguments had an associated arity of -1 which was not being
  handled correctly. That is being handled correctly now.

## 1.1.0 (2012-03-07)

 27 files changed, 2460 insertions(+), 849 deletions(-)

* With the usage of the URI parser from stdlib it is possible to
  validate the bucket URI more strictly. Also, it is possible to
  specify credentials in the URI like:
  http://username:password@example.com:8091/pools/default/buckets/custom

* The "default" connection is available in thread local storage. This
  mean that using the Couchbase.bucket method it is possible to get
  access to current connection and there is no need to share
  connections when running in multi-thread environment. Each thread
  has its own connection reference.

* The direct dependency on libevent and libsasl has been removed. Now
  the library doesn't require libevent headers installed.

* The disconnect and reconnect interfaces are implemented which
  provide routines for explicit resource management. Connections were
  freed only when the Garbage Collector found that the connection was
  not being used. Now it's possible for the client to check if the
  bucket was connected using 'connected?' or 'disconnect' it manually
  or 'reconnect' using old settings.

* There were spurious timeout issues with a compound statement like
  below. No timeout will occur unless there is a problem with the
  connection.

        connection.run do
          connection.get("foo") {|ret| puts "got foo = #{ret.value}"}
          sleep(5)
        end

* It is not required to install libcouchbase or libvbucket on windows.

* It is possible to store nil as a value. It is possible to
  distinguish a nil value from a missing key by looking at at the
  value returned and the flags and CAS values as well.

* Based on the time out fix (CCBC-20), clients will be notified when
  the connection was dropped or host isn't available.
